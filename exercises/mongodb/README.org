* MongoDB Exercises: Find the Digimons

You are going to use your mad MongoDB skillz to find the lost Digimons in
the data set. Can you collect them all??!

Make all the tests pass by solving the exercises. I have tried to order the exercises by difficulty and I recommend that you solve them in order.

*Preparations*
1. Ensure you have MongoDB running on your computer.
2. Make a copy of =exercises-template.js= called =exercises.js= in the same directory.
3. Run ~npm install~
4. Run ~npm test~

Running the tests should populate your database with Digimon data in a database called =mongodb-exercises=. You can verify with MongoDB Compass or by other means.

The data set is taken from [[https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/digidb/][Kaggle]].
